                <p>
                    Direct isolated cryotherapy is a therapeutic technique that involves the application of extreme cold temperatures to a specific area of the body using a cryotherapy device. This targeted approach allows for localized treatment of
                    pain, inflammation, and injury, as well as improving blood flow and reducing muscle soreness. During the treatment, the affected area is exposed to sub-zero temperatures ranging from -100°C to -160°C for a period of several
                    minutes. The cold temperature causes the blood vessels to constrict, which helps reduce inflammation and swelling. Direct isolated cryotherapy has gained popularity among athletes and individuals seeking alternative pain relief
                    methods.
